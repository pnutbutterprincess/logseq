Desert varnish is a dark brown coating of iron oxide, manganese, oxide which can coat rocks in [[desert]] environments. This shiny varnish forms when dust settles on a rock and in the presence of small amounts of moisture microbes such as bacteria on the rock transform the dust into iron or manganese precipitates, leaving a dark varnish on the rock. This takes a long time to form, and cannot form in humid climates where dust is washed away before ions can be extracted from it.
