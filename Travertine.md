[[Types of Chemical Sedimentary Rocks]]

Travertine is a chemical limestone. Most limestone is biochemical, but travertine is formed of crystalline calcium carbonate, which precipitates from groundwater

Some travertines (tufa) contain large pores
Travertine (lime scale) can preserve fossils which become entombed in tufa
