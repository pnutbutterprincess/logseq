- [[clastic sedimentary rock]]
- [[detrital]] [[sandstone]]
- Clast size: medium to coarse
- clast composition: quartz and feldspar, containing mostly quartz and at least 25% feldspar, and may contain mica along with lithic clasts
- Angularity/sphericity
- sorting
- sedimentary maturity: immature
- character of cement: generally quartz, and may have traces of [[calcite]] cement
- formation: generally formed from weathered [[igneous]] or [[metamorphic]] rock, typically [[granite]], and deposited in an environment where the minerals do not experience significant chemical weathering
