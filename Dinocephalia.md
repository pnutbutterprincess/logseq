An early clade of [[therapsid]]s from the middle [[Permian]]. 

Locomotion: a stiff spine and wide, heavy forelimbs, with longer, more upright hind limbs, used for propelling the creature forward. Limbs were longer than earlier [[pelycosaur]]s.

Feeding: sharp zig-zag incisors (and sometimes canines) at the front of the mouth for tearing off pieces of food 

Earliest dinocephalians: [[anteosaur]]s
[[tapinocephalia]]ns
