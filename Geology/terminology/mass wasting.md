rock or [[Geology/regolith]] (loose material) movement known informally as a landslide

Features determine the type of mass wasting
1. type of material (rock/regolith)
2. material velocity (slow/fast)
3. material quality (coherent/chaotic; wet/dry)
4. environment (subaerial/submarine)

Causes of mass wasting
1. shocks, vibrations, [[liquefaction]]
2. changes in slope load, steepness, or support
3. change in slope strength, primarily due to 3 factors
	1. weathering - supporting rocks are weakened
	2. vegetation - less vegetation weakens the slope
	3. water - water liquefies the material and adds additional weight
