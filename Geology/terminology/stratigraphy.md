Laws of Stratigraphy
1. Law of superposition: younger layers of rock sit atop older layers
2. Law of original horizontality: rock layers are originally deposited flat
3. Law of cross-cutting relationships: an intrusion will be younger than rock layers that are disturbed
4. Law of lateral continuity: rock layers are continuous until something blocks deposition
