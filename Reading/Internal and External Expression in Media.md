While film may seem better for expressing external aspects of storytelling, many techniques allow for useful introspection into the emotional states of the characters. In print, though the medium may seem weak in expressing visual aspects of story, the text allows for much more selective emphasis on descriptions of characters and settings, which cannot be ignored in film and risk becoming mundane. Interactive media provides a unique opportunity for introspection, as the player's own thoughts and feelings can inhabit the played character and lend a rich experience to the narrative.
