- Intrusive [[igneous]] rock forms below the surface of the earth
- *hypabyssal* intrusive rock is formed at very shallow depths
- *plutonic* intrusive rock is formed very deep beneath the earth's surface (>5km)
- Contact between intrusive rock and the surrounding <i>country rock</i> can be either *discordant* or *concordant*
- [[diapir]]ic intrusions are concordant intrusions where foliation is parallel to the contact due to a more plastic deformation of the country rock
- high temperature difference at the contact border results in a significant decrease in the intrusive grain size, a feature called a *chilled margin*
- the presence of [[xenolith]]s in intrusive rock records the type of country rock through which the magma traveled
