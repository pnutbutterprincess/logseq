- Early jawless [[chordate]]s from class [[conodonta]] that existed from the [[Cambrian]] to the beginning of the [[Jurassic]]
- Known primarily from the teethlike structures, called 'conodont elements' that were used to process food
- Soft structure preservation suggests they were eel-like and had large eyes
- Over 1500 species have been recorded, and conodonts are useful in [[biostratigraphy]] for identifying geologic time periods
