- a measure of how tightly ions are packed together in a mineral
- PI = (V1/VC) * 100
	- V1 - total volume of the ions in the unit cell based on their ionic radii
	- VC - unit cell volume
- For most minerals the packing index is between about 35 and 74
- In general, minerals formed at higher pressure have higher packing index than minerals formed at lower pressures
