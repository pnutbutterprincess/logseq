- a parameter related to [[strain]] that is represented by the Greek letter lambda *λ,* and is calculated as the square of the [[stretch]]
- λ = S^2
- reciprocal quadratic elongation, represented as λ' is used in the fundamental strain equations
	- λ' = 1/λ = 1/S^2
- the ratio of [[shear strain]] to quadratic elongation is also important in the fundamental strain equations
	- γ/λ
