- *ferrimagnetic/ferrimagnetism*
- Differs from [[ferromagnet]]ism in that some atoms/ions in adjacent structural sites in a [[mineral]] will have antiparallel [[magnetic moment]]s because of **exchange coupling** and will cancel each other
- As long as some atoms/ions do not have an antiparallel partner, the material will display [[ferromagnet]]ic properties
- [[magnetite]] is a ferrimagnetic mineral
