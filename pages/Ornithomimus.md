- #unclassified
	- <i>Ornithomimus sedens</i>
		- first named by [[Othniel Charles Marsh]] in [[1892]] from a partial skeleton from the [[Lance Formation]] in [[Wyoming]]
		- In [[1972]] [[Dale Russell]] couldn't determine if it was an [[ornithomimid]], [[Dromiceiomimus]], or [[Struthiomimus]], deciding on Ornithomimus in [[1985]]
		- From additional fragments found in [[Montana]] and [[Alberta]], it is now referred to as <i>Struthiomimus sedens</i>, but these have yet to be described and compared to the holotype
