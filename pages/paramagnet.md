- *paramagnetic/paramagnetism*
- [[mineral]]s in which the electrons of the atoms/ions do not have aligned [[magnetic moment]]s
- paramagnetic minerals have random alignments of unpaired electrons in the ions, so the net magnetic moment and net attraction are weak and the minerals are not noticeably attracted to a magnet
- Most [[iron]]-bearing [[silicate]] minerals are paramagnetic
