- geological context
- hand sample identification
	- observe and record crystal habit and/or grain shape. if crystals are well-developed, determine the crystal system to which they belong based on symmetry and the geometry of the crystals
	- observe and record color, luster, and streak. use a streak plate if it is available, otherwise just crush a bit of the sample
	- measure specific gravity
