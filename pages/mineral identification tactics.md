	- observe and record crystal habit and/or grain shape. if crystals are well-developed, determine the crystal system to which they belong based on symmetry and the geometry of the crystals
	- observe and record color, luster, and streak. use a streak plate if it is available, otherwise just crush a bit of the sample
	- measure specific gravity, using a Jolly balance, pychnometer, or heavy liquids, if sample size and purity allow. an estimate of specific gravity can sometimes be made by simply hefting the sample, if it is lard enough
	- measure the hardness by scratching with a fingernail (H=2-2.5), copper penny (H=3), knife blade (H=5), glass (H=5.5),
