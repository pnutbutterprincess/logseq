- noncoaxial deformation is a type of [[plane strain]] in which the body is sheared asymmetrically, so that the top and bottom do not change in orientation, only position relative to each other
- the height of the body does not change and all points move parallel to the direction of shearing
- [[simple shear]] is a type of noncoaxial deformation in which the top and bottom do not stretch or shorten, meaning the resulting shape retains its original area
