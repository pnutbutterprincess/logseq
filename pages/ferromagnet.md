- *ferromagnetic/ferromagnetism*
- Ferromagnetic materials are capable of holding a magnetic polarity because the [[magnetic moment]]s of the atoms/ions become systematically aligned
- An effect known as **exchange coupling** locks adjacent ions into parallel magnetic moments. These parallel alignments are generally restricted to microscopic volumes within a ferromagnetic grain, known as a **domain.** Adjacent domains don't necessarily have parallel alignments.
- Attraction to an external magnet is strong because the magnetic field rearranges the alignment of the magnetic domains
- If the external magnet is strong enough, the domains with alignment parallel to the magnetic field will expand, permanently magnetizing the material
