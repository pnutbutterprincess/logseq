- Worked at PSU, proctoring for testing services from 9am to 1pm
- Determined next two dishes to try making, both pasta
- Still need to make a shopping list for ingredients
- Played Palia with Lydia, did the temple of the Gales and caught 120 ancient flowbugs, and then we fished and hunted for a beetle plush (still no luck)
