Saurischian dinosaurs (lizard-hipped) are one of two major groups of dinosaurs, generally bipedal with the exception of the large [[sauropod]]s
Saurischian dinosaurs are divided into two major groups, [[sauropod]]s and [[theropod]]s
Also included was the [[prosauropod]]s, an early group of plant-eating dinosaurs that had small heads and long necks like their later descendants, the sauropods, but were able to be bipedal
